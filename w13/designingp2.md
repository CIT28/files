### Markdown Legend

Use these Markdown syntaxes in your `README.md` file:

- **Headings**
  - `#` for H1
  - `##` for H2
- **Outline**
  - `*` or `-` for bullet points

---

## Setup

1. Continue working in the `designing` folder.
2. Create a new file `p2-q.sql` by copying a previous query file.
   - Remove any old queries.
   - Update to have `pow-p2.txt` output file.
3. Add an H1 heading to your `README.md`:  
   ```markdown
   # Designing Part 2
   ```

## Lecture Notes (Start at 53:35)

### Column Constraints

üìç **Timestart:** 53:35  
1. Add a new H2 heading in `README.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Column Constraints
   ```
2. Take notes on each constraint using bullet point format.
3. Before coding:
   - Run the `DROP TABLE` statements (copy them from `p2-d.sql` or run them manually).
   - Copy the final queries from `p1-d.sql` into your `p2-q.sql` to restore the initial schema.

### Primary Key & Foreign Key

4. Add a new H2 heading:
   ```markdown
   ## Constraints: Primary Key and Foreign Key
   ```
5. Take notes on this topic, including the example queries.
6. Make sure to listen carefully to the student questions in the video.
7. At **1:00:19**:
   - Run your SQL.
   - Fix any errors.
   - Output the schema and a note to `pow-p2.txt`:
     ```
     .schema
     .print 'column constraints example'
     ```
   - üíæ **Commit Message:** `"column constraints"`

## Altering the Schema

üìç **Next topic: ALTER and CharlieCard schema**  
Carter uses an earlier version of the schema. Make sure yours matches before continuing.

### Set Up the Schema for Alteration

1. Drop all existing tables.
2. Copy the following into your `p2-q.sql`:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE "riders" (
        "id" INTEGER,
        "name" TEXT
    );

    CREATE TABLE "stations" (
        "id" INTEGER,
        "name" TEXT,
        "line" TEXT
    );

    CREATE TABLE "visits" (
        "rider_id" INTEGER,
        "station_id" INTEGER
    );
    ```

3. Run the queries to create the schema.
4. **Important:** Comment out these lines after running them.
5. Start writing `ALTER` commands below in `p2-q.sql`, commenting out each one after it‚Äôs run.

## BREAK OPTIONAL  
- If you got this far you can take a break and complete the rest of this work by the Thursday night deadline.  
- To "GET" this break you will submit your commit history for the designing folder now.
- I will do a review and give you feedback.
- If you complete before Thurs morning, then you can submit again your commit history URL and tell me that you are ready for a second review. 

### Altering Tables

üìç **Timestamp:** 1:03:54  
1. Follow along with Carter's `DROP TABLE` command.  
   ‚ûï Do this **in your `p2-q.sql` file**, not the terminal, so you have a reference.
2. Add a new H2 heading:
   ```markdown
   ## Altering Tables
   ```
3. Document at least **5 different alteration techniques**, including:
   - Mistakes made
   - Related SQL examples
4. Output `.schema` to `pow-p2.txt`.
5. Write the SQL to `DROP` all tables, run it, and then uncomment the previous setup code.
6. üíæ **Commit Message:** `"ALTER tables"`

---

## Final Steps

1. Rebuild the schema one last time to match Carter‚Äôs.
2. Code along and listen for questions and responses‚Äîtake notes.
3. Carter reviews all the techniques covered.  
   Add a new H1 heading and a summary in `README.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Summary
   ```
   - You may use a paragraph or bullet points.
   - Summarize how each SQL technique was applied.

4. Run your SQL to ensure no syntax errors.
5. Output `.schema` to `pow-p2.txt`.

üíæ **Final Commit Message:** `"updating schema"`
