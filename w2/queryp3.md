## Setup
- For this work we will still be working in the querying folder and will be saving our queries in a new file named p3-q.sql, create that file and copy the contents from p2-q.sql and follow along with the video to make other modifications to the pow code and then add this text as h1 (#) in your README.md file "Week 2 Querying Part 3", then commit with message: 
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "query file and README.md ready"**

## Timemark 21:49 to 46:01
- Start watching in 21:49 and then follow along with the Carter and write the SQL commands (query) in the terminal and once query runs without error copy it into query file (p3-q.sql) for this one there will be 6 queries using WHERE. 
- Then at 28:20 complete the pow and git workflow and commit your work with message:
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "WHERE, operators, NOT"**: 

- Comment out the queries from previous step.
- Then continue to code along and write the SQL commands (queries) in the terminal and once query runs without error copy it into query file (p3-q.sql) for this one there will be 2 queries. 
- At 31:49 write your understanding of NOT, AND, OR, () in your README.md file, using a markdown h2 (##) for the content, then complete the pow and git workflow and commit your work with message: 
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "WHERE, AND, OR and notes"**

# HEADS UP!  If you got this far you can take a break and complete the rest of this work by the Thursday night deadline.  Go ahead and submit your commit history and in your comment tell me you are taking the break and will complete by Thursday! 

- Comment out the queries from previous step.
- Then continue to learn how to write the WHERE command with NULL and IS NOT NULL, as before write the SQL commands (queries) in the terminal and once query runs without error copy it into query file (p3-q.sql) for this one there will be 2 queries.

- At 46:01 stop and in your README.md file, take a few notes on your understanding of the how these commands, use a markdown h2 (##) to show your content, then complete the pow and git workflow and commit your work with message:
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "WHERE, LIKE, %, _ and notes"** 

  
- Make sure to push your code to github
- Submit your commit history URL the querying in your private repo for grading
## Grading
This is how I will grade your work:
  1. Did you provide the correct commit history URL for querying folder = 5 points
  2. Did you do all the commits required for this work = 20 points
  3. Does your p3-q.sql contains all the queries written in the section = 30 points
  3. Does your pow3.txt have all the query output = 20 points (Mine had 469 lines)
  4. Did you include all the required content in the README.md file = 25 point
  5. Work submitted after the due date will be reduced by 25 points. If you completed all the requirements above, but submitted after the due date you will get 75 points (100 - 25) on this work.
