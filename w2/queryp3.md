## Setup
- For this work we will still be working in the querying folder and will be saving our queries in a new file named p3-q.sql, create that file and copy the contents from p2-q.sql and follow along with the video to make other modifications to the pow code and then add this text as h1 (#) in your README.md file "Week 2 Querying Part 3", then commit with message: 
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "query file and README.md ready"**

## Timemark 21:49 to 46:01
- Start watching in 21:49 and then follow along with the Carter and write the SQL commands (query) in the terminal and once query runs without error copy it into query file (p3-q.sql) for this one there will be 6 queries using WHERE. 
- Then at 28:20 complete the pow and git workflow and commit your work with message:
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "WHERE, operators, NOT"**: 

- Comment out the queries from previous step.
- Then continue to code along and write the SQL commands (queries) in the terminal and once query runs without error copy it into query file (p3-q.sql) for this one there will be 2 queries. 
- At 31:49 write your understanding of NOT, AND, OR, () in your README.md file, using a markdown h2 (##) for the content, then complete the pow and git workflow and commit your work with message:

# HEADS UP!  If you got this far you can take a break and complete the rest of this work by the Thursday night deadline.  Go ahead and submit your commit history and in your comment tell me you are taking the break and will complete by Thursday! 

- Comment out the queries from previous step.
- Then continue to learn how to write the WHERE command with NULL and IS NOT NULL, as before write the SQL commands (queries) in the terminal and once query runs without error copy it into query file (p3-q.sql) for this one there will be 2 queries.
