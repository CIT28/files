## CS50 Query Part 4
Right-click and select "Open in new tab" to watch [CS50 SQL - Lecture 0 - Querying](https://youtu.be/vHYeChEf2lA?si=hKFR9GDxKMU2JEYo)

## Setup
- For this work we will still be working in the querying folder and will be saving our queries in a new file named p4-q.sql Once you create that file copy the contents  of the p3-q.sql and remove any previous queries and update the sql to output to pow4.txt instead of pow3.txt.
- In the terminal make sure you are in the querying folder and run. ```sqlite3 longlist.db```
Then open another terminal session and change it to querying folder. You will use the second terminal to do the pow and git workflow. 
- Then in your README.md file make this a heading 1 (#) "Week 3 Querying Part 4", then complete the git workflow process and commit with message: 
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "query file and README.md ready"**

## Time mark 46:01 to the end

- Start watching in 46:01 and in your README.md add a heading 2 (##) for Operators and take notes on the operators. 
-  Then follow along by first writing each query on the terminal and once the query runs without error copy it into the p4-q.sql file.  
- Repeat this for all in the queries Carters writes, there will be a total of 6 queries.  For each query use the .print 'what does this query to' to describe each query.
- At 53:10 complete the pow and the git workflows and commit with message:
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "Operators and range queries"**
- Comment out the queries from above.
- Continue and take notes on the ORDER BY commands that will be covered in this video, add a heading 2 (##) into the README.md file. 
- Then follow along by first writing each query on the terminal and once the query runs without error copy it into the p4-q.sql file.  
- Repeat this for all in the queries Carters writes, there will be a total of 5 queries.  For each query use the .print 'what does this query to' to describe each query.
- Make sure you take some notes on ASC and DESC.
- At 1:02 complete the pow and the git workflows and commit with message:
  - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "ORDER BY and notes**

# HEADS UP!  If you got this far you can take a break and complete the rest of this work by the Thursday night deadline.  To get the BREAK you need to submit your commit history and in your comment tell me you are taking the break and will complete by Thursday! 

- Comment out the queries from above. 
- Start watching in 1:02:06 and take notes on the how to aggregate (SUM, AVG MIN, MAX and SUM) data in your README.md file. 
- Then follow along by first writing each query on the terminal and once the query runs without error copy it into the p4-q.sql file. 
- Interesting point about using MAX and MIN on string data.
- Take notes that will help you understand the concepts covered. 
- Repeat this for all in the queries Carters writes, there will be a total of 14 queries.  For each query use the .print 'what does this query to' to describe each query.
-  At 1:17:21, listen to the conclusion in your README.md add a heading for "My thoughts" and write at a good paragraph and what you learned from doing this code along. 
- Then complete the pow and the git workflows and commit with message: 
- **COMMIT MESSAGE - "aggregate queries and notes**

## Grading
This is how I will grade your work:
  1. Did you provide the correct URL for querying folder commit history = 10 points
  2. Did you do all the commits required for this work = 20 points
  3. Did you have all the queries in the p4-q.sql file = 25 points
  3. Did powp4.txt file contain the results and short description of each query  = 25 points
  4. Did you include all the required content in the README.md file = 20 points
  5. Work submitted after the due date will be reduced by 25 points. If you completed all the requirements above, but submitted after the due date you will get 75 points (100 - 25) on this work.
