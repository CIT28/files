# CS50 Problem Set 0 - Part 2
## Cyberchase - Problems 8 thru 13
- https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/psets/0/cyberchase/

## Setup
- In the cyberchase folder, create a new sql file named p2-q.sql and copy the p1-q.sql and remove previous queries and update for new sql filename and have the pow file named pow-p2.txt
- In the README.md create a new heading 1 md with text
    - Problem set 0 - Problems 8 thru 13 
- Start the normal terminal sessions 
- Commit Message - "setup for p2 cyberchase done"

### For each problem you need to do the following
1. Add heading 2 md text for each problem with the following text
    - 'Problem #'
    - add the backticks 
    - ``` your query attempt ```
2. Use the SQLITE3 terminal to write your SQL commands to solve the problem. 
    - Make sure you include the .print for each problem so that shows up in your pow file.
3. Once you have the correct output (see below for test) complete the poe workflow. 
    - Refer back to Week 4 Attendance instructions for how to complete the poe workflow.
4. For each Problem write a second query for each problem to count the results and use the AS (aliases)
5. Complete the pow and git workflow, commit with message:
        - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "Prob 8 complete"**

## Schema
Each database has some “schema” 
The tables and columns into which the data is organized. In cyberchase.db you’ll find a single table, episodes. In the episodes table, you’ll find the following columns:

- id, which uniquely identifies each row (episode) in the table
- season, which is the season number in which the episode aired
- episode_in_season, which is the episode’s number within its given season
- title, which is the episode’s title
- topic, which identifies the ideas the episode aimed to teach
- air_date, which is the date (expressed as YYYY-MM-DD) on which the episode “aired” (i.e., was published)
- production_code, which is the unique ID used by PBS to refer to each episode internally

## Specification

For each of the following questions, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular episodes: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular episode were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of episodes, for example, then your query should not also output each episodes’s air date.

Make sure you commit before moving on to the next problem. 

8. Write a query that counts the number of episodes released in the last 6 years, from 2018 to 2023, inclusive.
  - You might find it helpful to know you can use BETWEEN with dates, such as BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'.
9. Write a query that counts the number of episodes released in Cyberchase’s first 6 years, from 2002 to 2007, inclusive.
10. Write a SQL query to list the ids, titles, and production codes of all episodes. Order the results by production code,   from earliest to latest.
11. List the titles of episodes from season 5, in reverse alphabetical order.
12. Count the number of unique episode titles.
13. Write a SQL query to explore a question of your choice. This query should:
 - Involve at least one condition, using WHERE with AND or OR


## How to Test
- Executing 8.sql results in a table with 1 column and 1 row.
- Executing 9.sql results in a table with 1 column and 1 row.
- Executing 10.sql results in a table with 3 columns and 140 rows.
- Executing 11.sql results in a table with 1 column and 10 rows.
- Executing 12.sql results in a table with 1 column and 1 row.

## OPTIONAL BREAK!
- If you've completed problems 8 through 10, you can submit your commit history for the cyberchase folder and continue with steps 11 and 13 by the next due date. Be sure to include submission comment indicating that you're taking a break. If you finish early and would like to review your work, let me know in your submission comments.


## Grading
- Submit your commit history URL your cyberchase in your private repo for grading
- This is how I will grade your work:
1. Did you provide the correct URL for cyberchase folder = 10 points.
2. Did you do all the commits required for this work = 30 points
3. Did the commits contain the workflow (poe, pow and git ) data =  60 points
4. Work submitted after the due date will be reduced by 25 points.
